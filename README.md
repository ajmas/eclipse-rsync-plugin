Eclips Rsync Plugin

This plugin is designed to use rsync to synchronise code changes between
Eclipse and a remote location. This is useful, for example, if you
develop under Windows, but need to test your changes on a remote server.

This was originally developed by Alfredo Cerutti and is available in
its original form at http://rsyncplugin.sourceforge.net/
